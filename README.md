# openIndia

## Introduction

openIndia aims to compile the exact data that the government needs to make open to the public. This repository aims to define the:

1. Exact data for every department at every level.
2. Format of the data in it has to be made public.

This is the first step in evolving the government to be more transparent and introduce checks and measures that strengthen the administration.

## Open Governance

The internet age calls for governments to change the way they operate and disseminate information. From day to day working reports to the statistical data collected. It's important to make all these datasets public and readily available for both academic research and non governmental oversight organizations.

In the recent times government agencies and leaders are making an effort to make all relevant data public and accessible to their citizens. In order to maximize the benefits of these efforts further correspondence with the data consumers and the government is necessary. This direct feedback when coupled with open standards, software and formats would not only revolutionize the way governments are run but also greatly augment their accountability and the citizen's ability to get the most out of their government.

## Repository Organization

Each of the documents on the repository tries to outline the open data requirements for one particular office/administrative unit of the government.

Each of these documents has two parts, a requirements section which specifies the various datasets that should be made available by the administrative unit and an outline of the open standard that will be used to specify how the data should be formatted for distribution.

## Philosophy

- Keeping the entire process open ensuring that the change is the result of a community effort.
- Keep things simple, try to itemize everything and keep requirements and standards atomic without requiring references.
- Make branches and use 'markup' documents for all documentation.
- Create issues to propose changes to documentation structure and style.
- Keep in mind that all data should be easily consumable by computers.(be specific about metadata, markup , data depth and publishing models)
